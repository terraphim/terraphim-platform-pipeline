This expression is independent of the downstream E1 envelope protein sequence (Lo et al., 1994, 1995, 1996). The identity of this 17 kDa protein was unclear, and it was thought to be a truncated core protein. In this report, we demonstrate that this 17 kDa protein is synthesized by ribosomal frameshift and is derived mostly from the coding sequence that overlaps the core protein reading frame. This protein is highly conserved among different HCV isolates and is expressed during natural HCV infection, indicating that it may play an important role in the HCV life cycle.",

This overlapping ORF, which lacks an AUG codon near its 5\u2032 end, spans from nucleotide 5 to nucleotide 485 and has a coding capacity of \u223c160 amino acids. To investigate whether the 17 kDa protein is derived from this overlapping ORF, nucleotide 432 of the HCV-1 sequence coding for the core protein was converted from U to A to create a premature termination codon in the overlapping ORF (Figure 1). This mutation removed the last 18 codons of the overlapping ORF without affecting the core protein-coding sequence. If the 17 kDa protein is derived from this overlapping ORF, then this mutation should reduce the size of the 17 kDa protein by \u223c2 kDa without affecting the core protein. As shown in Figure 2A, the translation of the wild-type HCV-1 core protein RNA in vitro using rabbit reticulocyte lysates generated the 21 kDa core protein and the 17 kDa protein. In contrast, the translation of the HCV-1 RNA containing the U to A mutation at nucleotide 432 generated p21c and a smaller 15 kDa protein. This result strongly indicates that the 17 kDa protein is derived from the overlapping ORF.",

Thus, the 17 kDa protein must be synthesized by initiation from a non-AUG codon or by frameshift after translation initiation from the AUG codon of the core protein sequence. To distinguish between these two possibilities, the coding sequence of the HA tag, a sequence derived from the influenza virus hemagglutinin gene, was fused in-frame to the 5\u2032 end of the core protein-coding sequence. If the 17 kDa protein is synthesized from a non-AUG codon located near the 5\u2032 end of the core protein-coding sequence, then its synthesis should not be affected by the presence of the HA tag. On the contrary, if the 17 kDa protein is synthesized from the AUG codon of the core protein-coding sequence, then the HA tag should increase its size correspondingly. As shown in Figure 2B, the HA tag increased the size of both p21c and the 17 kDa protein by a similar amount. The presence of the HA tag in both p21c and the 17 kDa protein was verified by immunoprecipitation using an anti-HA antibody (data not shown). Thus, the results shown in Figure 2 indicate that the 17 kDa protein is synthesized from the initiation codon of the core protein sequence and terminates in the overlapping ORF.",

            "text": "The results shown in Figure 2 suggest a scenario of ribosomal frameshift for the synthesis of the 17 kDa protein. For convenience, we have named this protein \u2018F\u2019 protein for \u2018frameshifting\u2019. Since our previous results indicate that a mutation in codon 9 of the HCV-1 core protein-coding sequence significantly reduces the efficiency of F protein expression (Lo et al., 1994, 1995), the ribosomal frameshift for the synthesis of the F protein probably occurs in the vicinity of this codon. To investigate this possibility, we performed radiosequencing of p21c and F protein, which were synthesized in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine and [3H]lysine. Few [35S]methionine counts were detected in the first sequencing cycle whether p21c or the F protein was sequenced (Figure 3A and B; see also below), indicating the absence of the initiator methionine residue, presumably caused by the N-terminal peptidase activity in the translation extracts. As shown in Figure 3A, p21c generated three distinct [3H]lysine peaks at sequencing cycles 5, 9 and 11. There are four lysine residues at amino acids 6, 9, 10 and 12 of the p21c sequence (including the initiating methionine as residue 1). Since Lys9 and Lys10 were not expected to be resolved into separate peaks in the sequencing reaction, the p21c sequencing result was in agreement with the predicted p21c sequence excluding the initiating methionine residue. The sequencing of the F protein generated [3H]lysine peaks resembling those generated from the sequencing of p21c, except that the peak at cycle 11 had largely disappeared (Figure 3B and C). Since the [3H]lysine peak detected at cycle 9 was not affected, this result indicates that the sequences of p21c and the F protein diverge at or in the vicinity of codon 11, which thus predicts the location of the ribosomal frameshift.",

To investigate the possible role of these codons in ribosomal frameshift, codons 2\u20137 and 15\u201350, which flank the putative ribosomal frameshift site, were deleted from the core protein-coding sequence. As shown in lane 2 of Figure 4A, the deletion of these flanking sequences resulted in the synthesis of two smaller proteins, which were presumably the deletion mutants of p21c and the F protein. These two proteins were then labeled with [3H]threonine and [35S]methionine and subjected to radiosequencing. As shown in Figure 4B and C, a strong [35S]methionine signal was detected in the first sequencing cycle when either of these two proteins was sequenced. This result indicates that loss of the deleted sequences prevented the cleavage of the initiator methionine from these two proteins. A single [3H]threonine peak was detected at sequencing cycle 10 when the larger protein was sequenced (Figure 4B). This result is consistent with the predicted sequence of the p21c deletion mutant, which contains a threonine residue at position 10 (Figure 4B). The sequencing of the smaller protein generated two [3H]threonine peaks at sequencing cycles 6 and 9 (Figure 4C). The peaks in this case were broader than that seen in Figure 4B, suggesting a possible sequence heterogeneity. As mentioned above, the ribosomal frameshift site is predicted at or in the vicinity of codon 11 (Figure 3). A +1 ribosomal frameshift at codon 9, 10 or 11 would generate the sequence MQKKTNVTR, and at codon 12 would generate the sequence MQKKNNVTR at the N-terminus of the F protein mutant. The latter scenario does not appear likely since it would generate only one threonine residue at amino acid 8. In contrast, a \u20132 ribosomal frameshift at codons 9, 10 or 11 would generate the sequence MQKKKTNVTR, and at codon 12 would generate the sequence MQKKNTNVTR, for the F protein mutant. Both sequences contain two threonine residues at amino acids 6 and 9. Thus, the [3H]threonine sequencing result is consistent with the F protein being generated by a \u20132 ribosomal frameshift. However, due to the possible sequence heterogeneity observed in Figure 4B, some F protein may also be generated by +1 ribosomal frameshift.",

There is a stretch of 10 As at codons 8\u201311 of the core protein sequence (Figure 1). The slippage of T7 RNA polymerase at this region during transcription could fuse the F protein-coding sequence to the core protein-coding sequence. To rule out this possibility, we have used the enzymatic method to sequence directly a T7 transcript containing codons 8\u201314 of the HCV sequence. As shown in Figure 5, no apparent nucleotide deletion or insertion that would lead to the synthesis of the F protein was visible in this HCV sequence, indicating that the F protein was not likely to have been generated as a result of the sequence heterogeneity of the T7 RNA transcript.",

To investigate further whether this sequence can also mediate ribosomal frameshift in liver cells, we have fused the first 14 codons of the core protein sequence to the zero frame, the \u20132/+1 frame and the \u20131/+2 frame of the luciferase-coding sequence. The expression of the fused sequence was under the control of the EF1\u03b1 gene promoter. These DNA constructs, named FS(0)Luc, FS(\u20132/+1) and FS(\u20131/+2), are illustrated in Figure 6A. While the FS(0)Luc construct is expected to express the luciferase reporter as a fusion protein to the core sequence, FS(\u20132/+1)Luc can express the luciferase sequence only by \u20132/+1 ribosomal frameshift. The FS(\u20131/+2)Luc construct cannot express the luciferase sequence with or without ribosomal frameshift due to the presence of a termination codon in the \u20131/+2 reading frame immediately upstream of the luciferase reporter sequence. This construct serves as a negative control. These DNA plasmids were then transfected into Huh7 cells, a well differentiated human hepatoma cell line. A human growth hormone (hGH) reporter plasmid was also co-transfected to serve as an internal control for monitoring the transfection efficiency. As shown in Figure 6B, 1\u20132% luciferase activity was expressed by the FS(\u20132/+1)Luc construct relative to that expressed by the FS(0)Luc construct. In contrast, the FS(\u20131/+2)Luc negative control produced \u223c0.05% luciferase activity, which was near the background level. This result supports our observation that codons 1\u201314 of the core protein sequence can indeed mediate the \u20132/+1 ribosomal frameshift in Huh7 cells. This 1\u20132% efficiency of ribosomal frameshift is not unusual as it is similar to that which was reported previously for a number of genes (Grentzmann et al., 1998; Ivanov et al., 2000).",

For that reason, we decided to look for F protein-reactive antibodies in HCV patients. As mentioned above, a stretch of 10 As is located between codons 8 and 11 of the core protein-coding sequence. A single A nucleotide was deleted from this stretch to generate an F protein analog composed of the first 10 codons of the core protein sequence fused to the overlapping ORF. This F protein analog was synthesized in the presence of [35S]methionine in vitro, and immunoprecipitated with the sera isolated from six HCV patients and five hepatitis B virus (HBV) patients. As shown in Figure 7A, while none of the HBV sera immunoprecipitated the F protein analog, five of the six HCV sera (i.e. from patients 1, 4, 7, 10 and 11) clearly reacted with the F protein, while the sixth (from patient 3) showed weak reactivity. Since the F protein analog contains a 10 residue sequence from the core protein, it was possible that the immunoreactivity seen in Figure 7A was due to the presence of anti-core antibodies that recognized these 10 residues. To rule out this possibility, an AUG initiation codon was generated at the beginning of the overlapping ORF for the expression of a truncated F protein lacking the preceding core protein sequence. This coding sequence was then transcribed and translated in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine. The radiolabeled truncated F protein was immunoprecipitated with the same panel of patient sera. As shown in Figure 7B, weak but nevertheless detectable signals of the truncated F protein could be precipitated by the sera of all of the HCV patients except patient number 1. In a separate immunoprecipitation experiment, the serum of patient number 1 was also found to react weakly with the truncated F protein (data not shown). In contrast, all of the HBV sera generated no significant signals. To examine further the prevalence of anti-F antibodies in different HCV patients, we have also performed an enzymatic immunoassay on eight other HCV patients whose HCV genotypes are known. Two non-HCV serum samples were also tested to serve as negative controls. As shown in Table I, five of the eight HCV patients showed reactivities to the truncated F protein. Note that patients 6 and 8 displayed a negative response to the F protein prior to seroconversion. Thus, the results shown in Figure 7 and Table I strongly indicate that the F protein is produced during natural HCV infection in patients. Moreover, the results shown in Table I indicate that the expression of the F protein is not limited to genotype 1a.",

A survey of the HCV sequences compiled in the database indicates that the F protein ORF, which has a length of 162 codons, is conserved in 100% of the HCV genotype 1a sequences (Table II). Shorter forms ranging from 126 to 155 codons in length are also conserved in the great majority of the other HCV sequences reported. As shown in Table II, most HCV genomes of genotypes 1b and 2a have the capacity to code for the F protein with a length of 144 and 126 residues, respectively. Thus, the length of the F protein appears to be genotype specific. It is noteworthy that all of the infectious HCV clones that have been generated so far contain the intact F protein ORF (Kalykhalov et al., 1997; Yanagi et al., 1997, 1998, 1999; Beard et al., 1999; Lohmann et al., 1999), with genotype 1a encoding a 162 residue F protein (Kalykhalov et al., 1997; Yanagi et al., 1997), genotype 1b encoding a 144 residue F protein (Yanagi et al., 1998; Beard et al., 1999; Lohmann et al., 1999), and genotype 2a encoding a 126 residue F protein (Yanagi et al., 1999).",

It is unlikely that the F protein was synthesized as a result of the RNA sequence heterogeneity generated by the T7 RNA polymerase, as direct sequencing of the HCV RNA did not reveal a one nucleotide deletion or a two nucleotide insertion, which is required for the synthesis of the F protein. We previously reported that the F protein could be expressed from the HCV-1 core protein sequence in Escherichia coli (Lo et al., 1995). During the course of this study, we found that no detectable amount of the F protein could be expressed from the HCV-1 sequence in E.coli, and our previous result was caused by an unintended deletion of nucleotide 80, which fused the first 26 codons of the core protein sequence to the overlapping ORF to produce a protein resembling the F protein. The inability of the F protein to be expressed in E.coli also argues against a role for T7 RNA polymerase in the expression of the F protein, since the expression of the core protein in E.coli in our studies was also controlled by the T7 promoter (Lo and Ou, 1998).",

In our previous expression studies in mammalian cells, we found that the expressing efficiency for the F protein was substantially higher than 2% (Lo et al., 1995, 1996).

The F protein displays no clear sequence homologies to other proteins of known function except that it is highly basic with a pI of \u223c12.

The F protein sample was dialyzed against PBS, followed by a brief centrifugation in a microfuge. The protein was resuspended in 0.9 M acetic acid containing 6.25 M urea and purified on an acid\u2013urea gel (McNabb and Courtney, 1992). For the serological assay, 100\u2013125 ng of F protein were coated in a well of a microtiter plate and incubated with 20 \u00b5l of serum and 180 \u00b5l of diluent at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. The well was then washed and subsequently incubated with 200 \u00b5l of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-human antibody at 37\u00b0C for another hour. The sample was then washed again for color development.",
