            "text": "Positive (+)-strand RNA viruses have developed a wide range of strategies to express their genes. One recurring strategy, employed by many non-related viruses, entails the synthesis of subgenomic (sg) mRNAs (Miller and Koev, 2000). While the genome invariably serves as the mRNA for the viral replicase, the sgRNAs mediate the expression of structural and accessory proteins from cistrons, downstream of the replicase gene. These sg mRNAs are always 3\u2032-coterminal with the viral genome but, with regard to their synthesis, important differences exist among the various virus groups. For some viruses, e.g. brome mosaic virus (Miller et al., 1985), transcription initiation of sg mRNAs occurs at internal promoter sequences on a genome-length, negative (\u2013)-strand template. Alternatively, as proposed for red clover necrotic mosaic virus (Sit et al., 1998) and tomato bushy stunt virus (Choi et al., 2001), sg (\u2013)strand RNAs, resulting from premature transcription\u2013termination, may serve as templates. The Nidovirales, pathogens of vertebrates and invertebrates, are unique among (+)strand RNA viruses: the best studied nidoviruses, i.e. the corona- and arteriviruses, employ an unusual transcription mechanism, involving discontinuous RNA synthesis.",

Toro- and coronaviruses, because of their close evolutionary relationship (Snijder et al., 1990a), have been united taxonomically in the family Coronaviridae as separate genera (Cavanagh et al., 1993); the more distantly related arteri- and okaviruses (den Boon et al., 1991; Cowley et al., 2000) are assigned to the monogeneric families Arteriviridae and Roniviridae, respectively.",

Downstream, there are multiple smaller genes, which are expressed from a nested set of up to eight sg mRNAs. In the case of the arteri- and coronaviruses, these sg mRNAs are chimeric and both 3\u2032- and 5\u2032-coterminal with the genome: they all possess a 5\u2032 common leader sequence, which is derived from the 5\u2032 terminus of the genomic RNA and fused to the \u2018body\u2019 of the transcript (i.e. the 3\u2032-terminal part, which carries the coding information). Coronavirus leaders are 55\u201392 nucleotides in length, whereas those of arteriviruses measure \u223c200 nucleotides. The leader and mRNA body sequences are joined within a short conserved sequence motif, the transcription-regulating sequence (TRS), which precedes each transcription unit (van der Most and Spaan, 1995; de Vries et al., 1997; Lai and Cavanagh, 1997; Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998). A TRS is also found immediately downstream of the genomic leader sequence. Direct evidence that the TRSs are required for and determine the extent of sg mRNA synthesis was provided by mutagenesis studies (Makino et al., 1991; van der Most et al., 1994; van Marle et al., 1999).",

            "text": "Although there is general agreement that corona- and arteriviral mRNA synthesis involves discontinuous transcription, the models for the actual mechanism are still subject to debate. Initially, it was proposed that fusion of non-contiguous sequences occurs during (+)strand synthesis. Leader molecules, including the TRS, would be transcribed from the 3\u2032 end of a genome-sized, negative-strand RNA, anneal internally to complementary (anti-) TRS sequences on this (\u2013)strand template, and thus act as primers for transcription of mRNA body sequences (Lai et al., 1982b; Baric et al., 1983, 1985, 1987). The discovery of sg (\u2013)strand RNAs (Sethna et al., 1989), which carry anti-leader sequences (Sethna et al., 1991) and serve as templates for transcription (Sawicki and Sawicki, 1990), has led to an alternative model, in which discontinuous transcription takes place during minus-strand synthesis (Sawicki and Sawicki, 1990, 1995, 1998). This latter view is gaining increasing experimental support (Schaad and Baric, 1994; Chang et al., 1996; Krishnan et al., 1996; Baric and Yount, 2000; Sawicki et al., 2001). In a series of elegant reverse genetics experiments, Snijder and co-workers (van Marle et al., 1999; Pasternak et al., 2000, 2001) recently provided persuasive evidence that, in arteriviruses, leader\u2013body fusion indeed occurs during the synthesis of (\u2013)strand RNA, presumably via a process resembling similarity-assisted copy-choice RNA recombination. Template switching apparently is guided by base pairing between the anti-TRS on the nascent sg (\u2013)strand and the 5\u2032-most genomic TRS.",

However, the existence of a small leader (e.g. comprising the conserved sequence and some upstream nucleotides) could not be excluded rigorously. In particular, comparative primer extension analysis of BEV genomic and DI RNAs yielded conflicting results, raising doubts as to whether the DI sequences faithfully represented the 5\u2032 terminus of the BEV genome (Snijder et al., 1991).",

            "text": "Although most RNA viruses provide their (+)strand transcripts with a 5\u2032 cap (Furuichi and Shatkin, 2000), there are conspicuous exceptions. Information with regard to the capping of nidoviral RNAs is limited (Brian, 2001): direct evidence for capping has been presented only for the genome and sg mRNAs of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (Lai and Stohlman, 1981; Lai et al., 1982a) and for the genome of the arterivirus simian hemorrhagic fever virus (Sagripanti et al., 1986). In accordance with the latter observation, equine arteritis virus RNA transcribed in vitro from full-length cDNA templates is infectious only when provided with a cap (Glaser et al., 1999). To examine whether BEV mRNAs are capped, total cytoplasmic RNA was extracted from BEV-infected cells and subjected to immunoaffinity purification (IAP) using the cap-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) H20 (Bochnig et al., 1987; Kabrane Lazizi et al., 1999). As a negative control, IAP with an isotype-matched mAb R78, directed against the T-cell receptor, was performed in parallel. Affinity-purified RNAs were separated by formaldehyde\u2013agarose gel electrophoresis and subjected to in-gel hybridization with a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe 294. As this probe is designed after the 3\u2032 end of the BEV genome (Table I), the complete nested set of viral mRNAs can be visualized. Torovirus mRNAs specifically bound to mAb H20 (Figure 2A, lanes \u2018\u03b1Cap +\u2019). In short fluorographic exposures, only the smaller mRNAs 3\u20135 were seen; upon prolonged exposure, mRNA 2 could also be discerned. These results suggest that at least the sg mRNAs are capped. Most probably, however, full-length (intact) mRNAs 1 and 2 were selectively lost during IAP because of their large target size. In particular, RNA 1, with its length of 28 kb, is extremely vulnerable to mechanical shearing and enzymatic degradation.",

Samples were analyzed in parallel in denaturing and in non-denaturing agarose gels (Figure 2B). Whereas the 28S and 18S rRNAs were degraded, the BEV sg mRNAs appeared fully resistant to digestion. Also, RNA 1 proved resistant to Xrn1p; as determined by \u03b2-scanning, 70% of this RNA species survived treatment versus only 7.5% of the 18S rRNA.

Toroviruses thus differ in this respect from their closest relatives, the coronaviruses. Yet they are not unique among nidoviruses: GAV, a member of a recently recognized group of invertebrate nidoviruses (family Roniviridae, genus Okavirus) (Cowley et al., 2000), also specifies leaderless sg mRNAs (Cowley et al., 2002).

(1990b) previously proposed that the sequence UGUUUAG (residues 21 257\u201321 263), which is located 50 nucleotides from the S initiation codon, represents the TRS of sg RNA 2. However, RLM-RACE amplification of the 5\u2032-terminal sequences of RNA 2 with primer 1403 consistently yielded a 350 bp product (Figure 3A), suggesting that transcription initiation does not occur at the predicted site but some 150 nucleotides further upstream. Most surprisingly, the RLM-RACE product proved to be chimeric, comprising the 5\u2032-most 15\u201318 nucleotides of the genome fused to open reading frame 1b (ORF1b) sequences (Snijder et al., 1990a), within the stretch G21 133\u2013U21 136 (Figures 5 and 7). The chimeric product was not only found after RT\u2013PCR with M-MuLV Superscript and Taq polymerase, but also under more stringent conditions with Thermus thermophilus (Tth) DNA polymerase, in one-tube reactions at temperatures \u226560\u00b0C. In accordance with the RLM-RACE data, primer extension analysis with oligonucleotide 1403 yielded one major run-off product of 303 nucleotides (Figure 5). A minor product of 314 nucleotides was also observed, the 3\u2032 end of which would map to U21 108. There is no TRS-like sequence present at this location; the 314 nucleotide cDNA may well have arisen from premature termination during reverse transcription of mRNA 1 or from mispriming. The combined results of RLM-RACE and primer extension analysis would suggest that: (i) the proposed promoter motif UGUUUAG does not direct transcription; (ii) mRNA 2 extends far into ORF1b, at least up to U21 136; and (iii) perplexingly, mRNA 2 synthesis entails fusion of non-contiguous sequences.",

The nascent (\u2013)strand, presumably while still in complex with the RdRp, then detaches and switches to the leader TRS at the 5\u2032 end of the genome, which serves as the acceptor template. Upon anti-TRS\u2013TRS duplex formation, transcription resumes and synthesis of a chimeric, anti-leader-containing sg (\u2013)strand RNA is completed. We believe that an analogous similarity-assisted, copy-choice RNA recombination event during (\u2013)strand synthesis would best explain the chimeric structure of BEV sg RNA 2. Inspection of the mRNA 2 fusion region in ORF1b revealed the presence of a 17 nucleotide sequence (A21 118\u2013U21 134), which can adopt a stem\u2013loop structure (\u0394G = \u20138.6 kcal/mol). Strikingly, this hairpin loop immediately precedes the leader\u2013body junction site, followed by a stretch of 24 residues, with remarkable identity (79%) to residues 15\u201338 of the BEV genome (Figure 8A). Conceivably, this combination of sequence elements may create a recombinational hot spot, with the hairpin in the donor template causing attenuation of (\u2013)strand synthesis and dissociation of the RdRp\u2013RNA complex, after which the ORF1b-derived \u2018guiding\u2019 sequence mediates a template switch by base pairing to its complementary sequence at the 5\u2032 end of the viral genome (Figure 8B). Such a mechanism would not be without precedent. Studies on tombusvirus RNA recombination showed that the 3\u2032 base of a stem\u2013loop structure in the donor template is a preferred site for similarity-assisted template switching (White and Morris, 1995). Torovirus discontinuous transcription would, however, differ from that of corona- and arteriviruses: the TRSs of the latter are not preceded by evident hairpins (A.O.Pasternak and E.J.Snijder, personal communication; R.J.de Groot, unpublished).",

Yet, the BEV sg RNA promoter motif, 5\u2032 AC-N2\u20133-UCUUUAGA 3\u2032, is conserved in PoTV and is found immediately upstream of the PoTV genes for M, HE and N (S.L.Smits and R.J.de Groot, unpublished). However, as in BEV, the region upstream of the PoTV S gene does not contain an evident promoter motif. In fact, it bears a strong resemblance to the corresponding BEV sequence, and the potential stem\u2013loop structure is conserved. Most notably, as compared with the BEV element, there are two substitutions in the stem of the PoTV hairpin, but base pairing is maintained (C\u2013G\u2192U\u2013A; Figure 8A), reinforcing the notion that this RNA secondary structure may be relevant to discontintuous RNA 2 synthesis. Moreover, the similarities between BEV and PoTV suggest that the unusual combination of discontinuous and non-discontinuous transcription, displayed by BEV, does not result from tissue culture adaptation, but may also be employed by related naturally occurring toroviruses.",

            "text": "It is commonly held that discontinuous transcription arose in a proto-nidovirus and that this mechanism was preserved in corona- and arteriviruses. This would imply that, in toroviruses, discontinuous transcription was replaced by a non-discontinuous transcription strategy for three of the four sg mRNAs, while in okaviruses, leader addition via discontinuous transcription was lost completely. However, it seems counterintuitive that a trait that survived the considerable evolutionary distance between corona- and arteriviruses would have been lost during the radiation of the corona-, toro- and okaviruses, which seems to have occurred more recently (A.E.Gorbalenya, personal communication). We would therefore like to offer an alternative and equally plausible explanation, namely that the proto-nidovirus utilized an okavirus/torovirus-like non-discontinuous transcription strategy and that discontinuous transcription arose independently in arteri-, corona- and toroviruses through convergent evolution. Indeed, there are remarkable differences between arteri- and coronaviruses with regard to the sizes of their leaders and TRSs. High frequency homologous RNA recombination appears to be a universal trait of nidoviruses (Brian and Spaan, 1997; Lai and Cavanagh, 1997; Molenkamp et al., 2000), which may have made them prone to developing analogous discontinuous transcription strategies. In arteri- and coronaviruses, the transcription initiation and termination signals, initially combined in the ancestral nidovirus TRS, may have become separated. In this view, leader addition would be refinement of a common nidoviral transcription scheme, in which the central phenomenon is not the fusion of non-contiguous sequences, but rather the attenuation/termination of (\u2013)strand RNA synthesis at the TRS (Sawicki and Sawicki, 1995, 1998). Such a mechanism may have evolved to provide each of the sg mRNAs with an identical translational enhancer (i.e. a sequence element that increases translation efficiency).",

            "text": "This is the first report of an RNA virus that com bines two different strategies, discontinuous and non-discontinuous transcription, to produce its full set of sg mRNAs. Why toroviruses do so and how this situation arose is not known. If toroviruses evolved from an ancestor that relied on discontinuous mRNA synthesis, mRNA 2 transcription perhaps represents a relict. If, however, the torovirus ancestor utilized a non-discontinuous transcription strategy, the peculiar synthesis of mRNA 2 may be the consequence of a heterologous RNA recombination event. It is of note that the S gene overlaps with the replicase gene and, in contrast to the genes for M, HE and N, is not preceded by a non-coding IGR. A scenario can be envisaged in which the 5\u2032 part of the S gene, including the IGR and TRS, was deleted or replaced by a foreign sequence and in which a new initiation codon was acquired by fusion to an internal (\u20131) ORF at the 3\u2032 end of the replicase gene. If the resulting novel spike protein provided a strong selection advantage, even an initial inefficient expression may have allowed survival of the mutant virus. An infrequent, though consistent template switch in torovirus-infected cells, driven merely by chance sequence identity between ORF1b and the 5\u2032 end of the BEV genome, may have given rise to a minor transcription-competent sg (\u2013)strand RNA species. Subsequently, the discontinuous synthesis of mRNA 2 may have been perfected rapidly to optimize S expression. Be that as it may, torovirus transcription deserves further scrutiny.",

This technique involves the attachment of synthetic adaptor oligonucleotide to the 5\u2032 end of the mRNA. The adaptor is transcribed and included into the first-strand cDNA copy only when reverse transcription proceeds across the 5\u2032 terminus of the mRNA. To ensure that the adaptor is ligated exclusively to mRNAs with an intact 5\u2032 end, the RNA sample is pre-treated with calf intestinal phosphatase. Thus, contaminating rRNA, tRNA, degraded mRNA fragments and DNA are dephosphorylated and excluded from ligation reactions. mRNAs with an intact, capped 5\u2032 end are then decapped by treatment with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase, leaving a monophosphorylated 5\u2032 terminus and allowing subsequent ligation of the adaptor using T4 RNA ligase.
