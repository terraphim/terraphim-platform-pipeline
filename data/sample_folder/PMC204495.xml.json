            "text": "Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S.typhi murium) is a bacterial pathogen that invades and replicates within a membrane-bound compartment (Salmonella-containing vacuole; SCV) inside a variety of host cell types. The biogenesis and maturation of the SCV has been studied in detail in both macrophages and epithelial cells. Within a few minutes of bacterial entry, components of the early endocytic pathway, such as EEA1 and the transferrin receptor, are recruited to the SCV (early SCV; M\u00e9resse et al., 1999; Steele-Mortimer et al., 1999). These proteins are then gradually lost, and interactions between the SCV and late endosomal compartments lead to the progressive acquisition of the vacuolar ATPase and several lysosomal membrane proteins (lgps), such as LAMP1 (intermediate SCV; Garcia-del Portillo and Finlay, 1995; Rathman et al., 1997; M\u00e9resse et al., 1999; Steele-Mortimer et al., 1999). The late SCV represents the third stage of maturation which begins 3\u20134 h after invasion. It requires the intracellular synthesis of bacterial proteins and is characterized by the further recruitment of lgps and the initiation of Sif formation. Sifs are tubular structures enriched in lgps and which appear to be contiguous with the SCV (Garcia-del Portillo et al., 1993). However, the SCV does not accumulate significant amounts of the lysosomal enzymes that are normally delivered to a maturing phagolysosome by the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (Garcia-del Portillo and Finlay, 1995; Rathman et al., 1997). Interactions between the SCV and the endocytic pathway are therefore selective, and this unique trafficking pathway creates an environment permissive for bacterial cell division, which begins after a lag period of 3\u20134 h after invasion (Garcia-del Portillo et al., 1993).",

This TTSS translocates effector proteins into the vacuolar membrane and cytosol of the host cell. Several effectors have been identified in recent years, encoded both within and outside the pathogenicity island. SpiC is a SPI-2-encoded protein that prevents interactions between SCVs and endocytic compartments in macrophages (Uchiya et al., 1999). SifA is encoded outside SPI-2, and is required for maintenance of the vacuolar membrane, most likely by facilitating the recruitment and fusion of vesicles with the SCV (Beuz\u00f3n et al., 2000). SifA is also required for the formation of Sifs (Stein et al., 1996). SCV membrane dynamics are also influenced by the action of another effector, the predicted acyl transferase SseJ (Ruiz-Albert et al., 2002). Several other effectors have been described, but the functions of most of them are not understood (Waterman and Holden, 2003).",

We show here that the majority of SCVs become surrounded by Golgi membranes 4 h after invasion of epithelial cells, a process that is dependent on the SPI-2 TTSS effector SseG. Mutational analysis of this protein identified a Golgi-targeting domain and defined further regions that are required for recruitment of SCVs to the Golgi network. The physiological relevance of Golgi targeting by Salmonella is demonstrated by the requirement of both SseG and an intact Golgi network for Salmonella replication. Therefore, SCV\u2013Golgi interactions represent a crucial stage in the intracellular life cycle of Salmonella.",

Developing microcolonies usually comprised tight clusters of bacteria, positioned close to the nucleus (Figures 1A and 2A) and were often found closely associated with the Golgi network. Confocal X/Z reconstructions revealed that these microcolonies were partially or completely enveloped by Golgi membranes (Figure 1A; Supplementary figure S1 available at The EMBO Journal Online). This phenomenon was observed using antibodies against a variety of Golgi proteins, including giantin and Golgi matrix protein 130 (GM130) (Figure 1A and data not shown). Similar results were obtained using an antibody against TGN46, a glycoprotein localized primarily in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) (Figure 1B). In contrast, calreticulin, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) luminal protein, was not associated with microcolonies. As expected (Steele-Mortimer et al., 1999), there was no association between bacteria and early or recycling endosomal markers, including EEA1 and the transferrin receptor (data not shown). At 8 h after invasion, 84 \u00b1 6% of microcolonies of GFP-expressing wild-type bacteria were associated with Golgi membranes. The labelled Golgi proteins were concentrated in the area around the developing microcolony, rarely between individual SCVs.",

HeLa cells were infected with different mutant strains, then fixed and analysed by confocal microscopy for bacterial association with the Golgi network. SCVs were considered Golgi-associated if they were at least partially surrounded by Golgi membranes. The percentage of wild-type bacteria associated with the Golgi steadily increased to \u223c80% over a 10 h period. However, a strain carrying a mutation in ssaV, which is defective for secretion of all SPI-2 TTSS effector proteins, had a significantly reduced level of association with the Golgi network; <20% of bacteria were associated with the Golgi at any time during the experiment (Figure 2A and B). Although ssaV mutant bacteria remained predominantly perinuclear, in contrast to the wild-type strain they displayed a scattered distribution (Figure 2A). No differences were observed between the wild-type and strains carrying mutations in phoP or spvB (data not shown), two virulence loci that are involved in growth of Salmonella in macrophages (Holden, 2002). To identify the SPI-2 effector responsible for this phenotype, strains carrying mutations in genes encoding different SPI-2-translocated proteins were examined. Whereas sseJ and sseI mutant strains were indistinguishable from the wild-type, an sseG mutant strain had a phenotype similar to that of the ssaV mutant (Figure 2A and C). The Golgi-targeting defect of the sseG mutant could be attributed to a lack of SseG because a plasmid containing the wild-type sseG allele restored association with the Golgi to the level of the wild-type strain (Figure 2C). Inactivation of SseG leads to a replication defect in macrophages and moderate virulence attenuation in the mouse model of systemic salmonellosis (Hensel et al., 1998). SseG is predicted to have at least two transmembrane domains; its primary amino acid sequence displays no significant similarities to protein database entries, apart from a 31% similarity to SseF, which is encoded immediately downstream of sseG (Hensel et al., 1998).",

In contrast, the sseG mutant numbers increased by <10-fold over the same time period, a replication defect similar to that of the ssaV mutant (Figure 4A). Since SseG is required for both Golgi localization of bacteria and intracellular replication, we hypothesized that the Golgi network might be exploited by Salmonella for its replication. Therefore, the number of wild-type bacteria in Golgi-associated microcolonies was compared over time with those located elsewhere in the cell by microscopic examination. There was no significant increase in numbers of bacteria not associated with the Golgi network, whereas the numbers of Golgi-associated bacteria underwent a significant increase over a 9 h period (Figure 4B). This result suggests that bacterial replication is restricted to those associated with the Golgi.",

BFA inhibits nucleotide exchange on the small GTPase ADP-ribosylating factor (Arf1), which is required for formation of COPI coated vesicles (Chardin and McCormick, 1999). As a result, the Golgi network rapidly redistributes into the ER (Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 1989). BFA strongly inhibited intracellular growth of wild-type S.typhimurium, but had little effect on numbers of ssaV mutant bacteria (Figure 4C). However, BFA had no noticeable effect on markers of the maturation and trafficking of the SCV, such as LAMP1 recruitment and cathepsin D exclusion (data not shown). Therefore, the effects of BFA appear to be independent of the selective interactions between SCVs and the late endocytic pathway. As a further test for the requirement of a functional Golgi network in S.typhimurium replication, bacteria were examined in HeLa cells expressing Arf1T31N-GFP, a dominant interfering variant of Arf1 (Dascher and Balch, 1994). A significant reduction in intracellular bacterial numbers was observed at 12 h after invasion, compared with bacterial replication in cells expressing GFP alone (Figure 4D). Sar1 is another small GTPase, involved in COPII-mediated vesicle formation, and its inhibition by constitutively inactive Sar1T39N prevents the formation of early secretory vesicles at ER exit sites (Ward et al., 2001). Bacterial replication was also severely inhibited in cells expressing this mutant protein (Figure 4D). Expression of Arf1T31N-GFP or Sar1T39N had no effect on bacterial internalization (Supplementary table S1). Together, these experiments establish that an intact and functional Golgi network is required for intracellular replication of S.typhimurium.",

To verify that myc::SseG was localized to the Golgi network, transfected cells were incubated with BFA for 1 h, and either fixed immediately or washed in medium lacking BFA, and incubated for a further 1 h. In all transfected cells, BFA caused extensive redistribution of myc::SseG throughout the cell, where most of it co-localized with dispersed TGN46 (Figure 5A). Following BFA wash-out, TGN46 moved back to its original perinuclear position and was accompanied by myc::SseG (Figure 5A). Subcellular fractionation of transfected cells and immunoblotting showed that SseG localized to the membrane fraction, as expected for a predicted integral membrane protein (data not shown). In transfected cells that strongly overexpressed myc::SseG, the Golgi network was disrupted.

In addition, the N-terminal region is unusual in that 9 of the first 31 amino acids are prolines. To identify the region(s) of SseG that confer its localization to the Golgi, a series of myc-tagged truncated versions was constructed and expressed in HeLa cells after transfection. Progressive deletions from the N- and C-termini (\u03941, \u03942, \u03943, \u03944, \u03945, \u03946, \u03947) identified a 55 amino acid region including HR2 that is necessary and sufficient for Golgi targeting of SseG (Figure 6B). Removal of either HR2 (\u03949, \u039410, \u039411) or the region between HR2 and HR3 (\u03948) resulted in a complete loss of Golgi targeting and the mutant proteins were instead redistributed in a punctate manner throughout the cell (Figure 6B and C). Therefore, information in the second TMD and its carboxy-flanking region are required for Golgi targeting. Sequence comparisons between this domain and known eukaryotic and viral Golgi-targeting sequences have failed to reveal any significant similarities.",

The myc epitope serves as a marker for the N-terminus of SseG and the anti-SseG antibody recognizes the C-terminus of the protein. An antibody against a luminal epitope of galactosyltransferase (GalT) was used as a control for the integrity of Golgi membranes. Following exposure of cells to digitonin, Golgi-associated SseG was readily detected by the anti-myc and anti-SseG antibodies. However, there was no labelling of GalT unless the cells were exposed to Triton X-100, which is a non-specific membrane permeabilizing detergent.

It follows that SseG contains only two TMDs, which are most likely HR1 and HR2. Therefore, either or both N- and C-terminal regions of the protein might be involved in localizing SCVs to the Golgi network. To test this, variants of SseG were expressed in HeLa cells and assayed for their ability to restore association of the sseG mutant strain with the Golgi network. First, cells were transfected with a construct expressing full-length myc::SseG, then infected with GFP-expressing wild-type or sseG mutant bacteria for 10 h, and examined for bacterial localization. Expression of myc::SseG or mutant versions did not affect the ability of wild-type bacteria to localize efficiently to the Golgi network (Figure 7B), indicating that these proteins did not exert a dominant-negative effect on Golgi targeting by wild-type bacteria. Ectopically expressed myc::SseG restored Golgi localization of the sseG mutant strain to the level seen with the wild-type strain (Figure 7B). Expression of mutants \u03948 and \u039410, which were not Golgi associated, did not rescue Golgi localization to the sseG mutant. However, mutants \u03941, \u03944 and \u03946, which were efficiently Golgi-localized (Figure 6B), also failed to rescue the sseG mutant phenotype (Figure 7B). These results demonstrate that in addition to a requirement for the Golgi-targeting region of SseG, information in both the C- and N-terminal regions of the protein is required for the interaction between SCVs and the Golgi network. To determine if other SPI-2 effectors might be involved in Golgi-targeting, myc::SseG was tested for its ability to restore Golgi localization of ssaV (SPI-2 null mutant) bacteria. In contrast to the sseG mutant, Golgi localization of the ssaV mutant could not be rescued by ectopic expression of SseG (Figure 7B). This result suggests that other SPI-2 translocated effectors contribute to the process of Salmonella localization to the Golgi network.",

Since this stage involves bacterial replication, we refer to it as the replicative SCV. Therefore, maturation of the SCV proceeds not only by progressive and selective interactions with the endocytic pathway but also in terms of the spatial distribution of SCVs in the host cell, and their interaction with the secretory pathway.

Incorporation of Golgi-derived lipids is thought to provide a mechanism for growth and maintenance of the Chlamydia inclusion membrane (Hackstadt et al., 1997). Therefore it is possible that SseG could mediate a similar function in acquiring lipids for the SCV membrane. BFA treatment of Chlamydia-infected cells leads to smaller, morphologically abnormal inclusions, but does not affect bacterial multiplication (Hackstadt et al., 1996). In contrast, BFA had no effect on the integrity or morphology of the SCV membrane, as judged by LAMP1 labelling (data not shown), but strongly inhibited Salmonella replication. Furthermore, Chlamydia inclusions do not interact with endocytic organelles (Wyrick, 2000), whereas the SPI-2 effector SifA has a major role in the recruitment and probably fusion of lgp-containing vesicles to the SCV membrane (Ruiz-Albert et al., 2002). Indeed, mutation of sifA results in a strain that cannot maintain the physical integrity of its vacuolar membrane (Beuz\u00f3n et al., 2000). Therefore Salmonella appears to exploit late endocytic organelles as a source of membrane that is required to enclose replicating bacteria, and it seems more likely that interactions between SCVs and the Golgi satisfy a nutritional requirement, for example by providing carbon and/or nitrogen sources which are necessary for bacterial replication.",

First, sseG mutant bacteria fail to localize to the Golgi network of infected cells. Second, this defect can be rescued efficiently by ectopic expression of full-length SseG in infected cells, but not by a version lacking the Golgi-targeting domain. In infected cells, SseG was found associated with SCVs and in peripheral punctate structures, which occasionally co-localized with Golgi markers. How then does translocated SseG account for bacterial association with the Golgi? Apart from its Golgi-targeting region, both the proline-rich N-terminal domain and information in the C-terminal 51 amino acids contribute to the localization of SCVs to the Golgi network. Furthermore, localization of sseG mutant but not SPI-2 null mutant bacteria to the Golgi can be rescued by the ectopic expression of SseG in HeLa cells. These results suggest the existence of another SPI-2 effector that functions together with SseG to mediate Golgi localization of SCVs. Alternatively the null mutant may be defective in earlier unrelated processes of vacuole maturation, on which SseG function is dependent. Translocated SseG might interact with its target membrane via the Golgi-targeting domain, and to another effector through its N- or C-terminal regions.

The major conclusion to emerge from the work described here is that while these interactions are necessary for bacterial survival, they are not sufficient for intracellular replication: this requires SCV interactions with the secretory pathway. The identification of SseG as a Golgi-targeting virulence protein provides the basis for further investigation into the mechanisms by which this pathogen replicates in host cells, could provide insights into the normal functioning of the Golgi network and might ultimately offer novel approaches to inhibit bacterial growth in host cells.",
