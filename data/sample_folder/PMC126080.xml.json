            "text": "The viral proteins required for TGEV genome replication and transcription are encoded by the replicase gene (Eleouet et al., 1995; Penzes et al., 2001). This gene encodes two replicative polyproteins, pp1a (447 kDa) and pp1ab (754 kDa) that are processed by virus-encoded proteinases to produce the functional subunits of the replication complex (reviewed in Ziebuhr et al., 2000). The central and C-proximal regions of pp1a and pp1ab are processed by a 33.1 kDa viral cysteine proteinase which is called the \u2018main proteinase\u2019 (Mpro) or, alternatively, the \u20183C-like proteinase\u2019 (3CLpro). The name \u20183C-like proteinase\u2019 was introduced originally because of similar substrate specificities of the coronavirus Mpro and picornavirus 3C proteinases (3Cpro) and the identification of cysteine as the principal catalytic residue in the context of a predicted two-\u03b2-barrel fold (Gorbalenya et al., 1989a,b). Meanwhile however, several studies have revealed significant differences in both the active sites and domain structures between the coronavirus and picornavirus enzymes (Liu and Brown, 1995; Lu and Denison, 1997; Ziebuhr et al., 1997, 2000; Hegyi et al., 2002). Also, the crystal structures reported for a number of picornavirus 3C proteinases (Allaire et al., 1994; Matthews et al., 1994; Bergmann et al., 1997; Mosimann et al., 1997) have not been useful in predicting the three-dimensional structures of coronavirus main proteinases. Because of the large phylogenetic distance between the two groups of enzymes, we will use the term coronavirus Mpro throughout this article.",

Accordingly, the TGEV Mpro has 302 amino acid residues that correspond to the pp1a/pp1ab residues 2879\u20133180. In vivo and in vitro analyses of avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and human coronavirus 229E (HCoV 229E) Mpro activities have shown consistently that the proteinase cleaves the replicase polyproteins at 11 conserved sites and, therefore, it seems reasonable to conclude that the Mpro-mediated processing pathways are conserved in all coronaviruses, including TGEV.",

In TGEV Mpro, these are Cys144 and His41. There has been some debate on the existence of a third residue in the catalytic centre. In common with picornavirus 3C proteinases, the catalytic centre of the coronavirus Mpro is predicted to be embedded in a chymotrypsin-like, two-\u03b2-barrel structure in which cysteine (rather than serine) serves as the principal nucleophile. (ii) Coronavirus main proteinases have well-defined substrate specificities. All known cleavage sites contain bulky hydrophobic residues (mainly leucine) at the P2 position, glutamine at the P1 position, and small aliphatic residues at the P1\u2032 position. (iii) Coronavirus main proteinases possess a large C-terminal domain of \u223c110 amino acid residues that is not found in other RNA virus 3C-like proteinases. The characterization of recombinant proteins, in which 33, 28 and 34 C-terminal amino acid residues were deleted from the IBV, MHV and HCoV main proteinases, respectively, resulted consistently in dramatic losses of proteolytic activity, suggesting that the C-terminal domain of Mpro contributes to proteolytic activity through undefined mechanisms.",

In contrast to papain, but in agreement with the picornavirus 3C proteinases, the sulfur atom is in the plane of the histidine imidazole.

In proteinases of the papain family, an asparagine is the third member of the catalytic triad. Chymotrypsin and other members of this serine proteinase family have a catalytic triad consisting of Ser195...His57...Asp102. In HAV 3Cpro, Asp84 is present at the required position, although its side chain points away from His44, making its role disputable (Malcolm, 1995; Bergmann et al., 1997). PV 3Cpro, human rhinovirus (HRV) 3Cpro and HRV 2Apro have a glutamate or aspartate in the proper orientation to accept a hydrogen bond from the active site histidine (Matthews et al., 1994; Mosimann et al., 1997; Petersen et al., 1999). In contrast, TGEV Mpro has Val84 in the corresponding position, with its side chain pointing away from the catalytic site (Figure 6B and C). A buried water molecule is found in the place that normally would be occupied by the side chain of the third member of the catalytic triad. This water molecule makes hydrogen bonds to His41 N\u03b41, His163 N\u03b41 and Asp186 O\u03b41 (Figure 6B). His163 is not conserved among coronavirus main proteinases and its substitution by leucine (Mpro-H163L) had no significant effect on the proteolytic activity in the standard peptide assay (see Materials and methods), as compared with the activity of the wild-type Mpro (Table I). Asp186 makes a salt bridge to Arg40 that appears to be required to maintain the active site geometry, since both Asp186 and Arg40 are absolutely conserved among coronaviruses. Through this (and other) interaction(s), the polypeptide segment 184\u2013199, which connects domains II and III and is probably involved in substrate binding (see below), is held in the proper position. Taken together, the data contradict a direct involvement of His163 or Asp186 in catalysis, making the TGEV Mpro a clear case of a viral cysteine proteinase employing only a catalytic dyad.",

This leads us to believe that, similarly to 3Cpro (Matthews et al., 1994; Bergmann et al., 1997; Mosimann et al., 1997), specific substrate binding by Mpro is ensured by well-defined S4, S2 and S1 specificity pockets. In order to visualize potential interactions with the substrate, we have modelled a pentapeptide representing the P5\u2013P1 residues of a TGEV Mpro cleavage site (Asn\u2013Ser\u2013Thr\u2013Leu\u2013Gln, pp1a amino acids 2874\u20132878; Hegyi and Ziebuhr, 2002) into the substrate-binding cleft of Mpro (Figure 7). The model is based on the assumption that Mpro binds substrates in a manner analogous to that found in complexes of chymotrypsin-like proteinases with peptide inhibitors. X-ray structures have shown that the P4\u2013P1 residues of peptide inhibitors assume a common main chain conformation when bound to these proteinases, with the P4 and P3 residues adopting a \u03b2 conformation and the P2 and P1 residues assuming a specific main-chain conformation suitable to place their side chains in the pre-formed S1 and S2 specificity pockets (James et al., 1980; Fujinaga et al., 1985, 1987, Matthews et al., 1999). These studies lead us to suggest that the residues P5 to P3 of Mpro substrates may form an antiparallel \u03b2-sheet with segment 164\u2013167 of the long strand eII on one side, and with the segment 186\u2013191 (which links domains II and III) on the other. Hydrogen bonding interactions are likely between the main chain amide and carbonyl oxygen atoms of substrate residues Thr(P3), Ser(P4) and Asn(P5) and the main chain atoms of TGEV Mpro residues Glu165, Ser189 and Gly167 (see Figure 7).",

            "text": "It has been shown for the HAV, HRV and PV 3Cpro enzymes that the imidazole side chain of a conserved histidine, which is located in the centre of a hydrophobic pocket, interacts with the P1 carboxamide side chain of the substrate. This interaction is generally accepted to determine the picornavirus 3Cpro specificity for glutamine at P1 (Matthews et al., 1994, 1999; Bergmann et al., 1997; Mosimann et al., 1997). Mutational analyses revealed that any replacement of His162 completely abolished the proteolytic activities of the HCoV and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) Mpro enzymes (Ziebuhr et al., 1997; Hegyi et al., 2002). The structure shows that the imidazole side chain of His162 is positioned suitably to interact with a P1 glutamine side chain. His162 is located at the very bottom of a hydrophobic pocket which is formed by residues Phe139 and the main-chain atoms of Ile140, Leu164, Glu165 and His171. The side chain of Glu165 forms an ion pair (2.96 \u00b1 0.14 \u212b) with His171. This salt bridge is itself on the periphery of the molecule, forming part of the \u2018outer wall\u2019 of the S1 subsite. Accordingly, mutants of the HCoV 229E Mpro, in which the residue equivalent to His171 had been replaced by alanine, serine or threonine, retained significant proteolytic activities (Ziebuhr et al., 1997). In order to interact with the P1 glutamine side chain of the substrate, His162 has to maintain a neutral state over a wide pH range. Most probably, this is achieved by two important interactions: (i) stacking onto the phenyl ring of Phe139, at a distance of 3.53 \u00b1 0.18 \u212b; and (ii) accepting a hydrogen bond from the buried Tyr160 hydroxyl group which has no other hydrogen-bonding partner. The role proposed for the hydroxyl group of Tyr160 is strongly supported by FIPV Mpro mutagenesis studies in which the proteolytic activities of Y160F, Y160G, Y160A and Y160T mutants were shown to be dramatically reduced (Hegyi et al., 2002). Tyr160 is part of the absolutely conserved coronavirus Mpro sequence signature, 160Tyr-X-His162 (Figures 1 and 2), whereas Gly(Ala)-X-His is found at the equivalent sequence position in most 3C and 3C-like proteinases (Gorbalenya et al., 1989a). Accordingly, in the 3C and 3C-like proteinases, stabilization of histidine in the neutral tautomeric state has to be ensured by other residues. Notably, in the case of PV 3Cpro, this involves a tyrosine residue (Tyr138) which, however, is provided by a different part of the structure (\u03b2-strand cII; Mosimann et al., 1997). For HAV 3Cpro, other mechanisms are proposed (Bergmann et al., 1997).",

It involves a relatively small area of 337 \u00b1 45 \u212b2 and comprises only two hydrogen bonds, between the amide group of Gly281 (molecule A) and the main-chain oxygen of Ser279 (molecule B), as well as its symmetry mate, Gly281B...Ser279A (3.22 \u00b1 0.37 \u212b, averaged over all six monomers).",

            "text": "Interestingly, the N-terminal residues of each monomer are relatively close to the substrate-binding site of the other monomer in the dimer. The following observations for monomer A hold true for all other monomers. The NH3+ group of Ser1A, which is the P1\u2032 residue of the autocleavage reaction of TGEV Mpro, is 11.9 \u00b1 1.6 \u212b from the active site Cys144B S\u03b3 of the second molecule in the dimer but as much as 34.2 \u00b1 0.9 \u212b away from its own active site cysteine. Ser1A is in contact with residues participating in the substrate-binding site of monomer B. Its NH3+ group makes a salt bridge (4.99 \u00b1 1.04 \u212b) to the carboxylate of Glu165B (Figure 8). This glutamate, which is absolutely conserved among coronaviruses, is part of the S1 subsite (see above), where it also interacts with His171. Although these two side chains form the \u2018wall\u2019 of the specificity site, they have their polar groups oriented towards the surface of the proteinase molecule and away from the substrate\u2019s P1 glutamine. An intermolecular ionic interaction between Arg4A and Glu286B (6.0 \u00b1 0.7 \u212b) appears to play a role in positioning the N-terminal residues. Because of the 2-fold non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS), the same interaction occurs between Arg4B and Glu286A. Residues 6A\u20138A form a short \u03b2-strand interacting with strand cII of monomer B (at Val124B). Most of the interactions between the N-terminus of molecule A and the region next to the S1 subsite of molecule B constitute a perfect fit. Given the fact that the P\u2032 residues in serine and cysteine proteinases constitute the leaving group of the cleavage reaction and, in coronavirus main proteinases, are not subject to stringent specificity requirements, it is quite conceivable that, after autoproteolysis, the N-terminus of one monomer slides over the active site of the partner monomer and adopts the position seen in our crystal structure, i.e. with Ser1A interacting with Glu165B at the \u2018outer wall\u2019 of the S1 subsite. This, in turn, would suggest that the dimer we are seeing corresponds to the product of the autolysis reaction and that this occurs in trans. Molecular modelling revealed that binding of the Mpro N-terminus in the active site cleft of the same molecule would require remodelling of the entire N-terminal segment and beyond (residues 1\u201313; data not shown), making cleavage in cis less likely. There is additional experimental evidence supporting these conclusions. First, dilution experiments with MHV Mpro translated in vitro contradict cis-cleavage activity (Lu et al., 1996). Secondly, the fact that, early in infection, Mpro remains part of a relatively stable 150 kDa precursor protein in which it is flanked by hydrophobic domains (Schiller et al., 1998) argues against rapid autoprocessing in cis. The proposed model of intermolecular self-processing would imply that components of the replication complex could first be anchored to membranes (i.e. the site of RNA replication) in an uncleaved form, and only later, when the precursor proteins accumulate to high local concentrations, will Mpro release itself by intermolecular cleavage, thereby triggering the complete spectrum of trans-processing reactions.",

            "text": "A specific conformation of the N-terminal segment allows it to \u2018squeeze\u2019 residues 1\u20138 in between domains II and III of the same monomer and domains II and III of monomer B (see above and Figure 8). In this context, the N-terminus also interacts with domains II and III of its own protomer. For example, the side-chain amino group of Lys5A makes strong intramolecular hydrogen bonds with Ser110A O\u03b3 of domain II (2.83 \u00b1 0.15 \u212b), and with the Glu286A main chain oxygen (2.80 \u00b1 0.07 \u212b), as well as with Glu291A O\u03b51 (2.74 \u00b1 0.13 \u212b) of domain III. Furthermore, the side chain of Leu3A completes a hydrophobic patch on domain III which includes Phe206A, Ala209A, Phe287A, Val292A, the C\u03b2 atom of Gln295A and Met296A; these residues belong to helices B and F. All sequenced members of the coronavirus proteinase family have a hydrophobic residue in position 3, while glycine is absolutely conserved in position 2 (see Figure 1). The latter residue adopts the \u03b1L conformation which is easily accessible only to glycine. To investigate the functional significance of these interactions, a recombinant protein, Mpro\u03941\u20135, in which the N-terminal residues Ser1\u2013Lys5 were removed from the Mpro sequence, was expressed and tested for proteolytic activity in a trans-cleavage assay using a 15mer peptide representing the N-terminal TGEV Mpro autoprocessing site. As shown in Table I, the activity of Mpro\u03941\u20135 was decreased to only 0.3% of the Mpro activity. We conclude from these data that, indeed, residues 1\u20135 may be critically involved in stabilizing the mutual orientation of domains II and III and thus, indirectly, in maintaining the proper orientation of the intervening loop region (residues 184\u2013199). If this hypothesis is correct, then the deletion of domain III should have similarly detrimental effects on the proteolytic activity and, in fact, the published data (see Introduction) seem to support this conclusion. To corroborate this hypothesis further, an additional set of Mpro mutants was characterized in which we used the structural information to remove domain III completely. In this approach, the probability of domain III misfolding, which might have been the cause of Mpro inactivation in previous studies using randomly \u2018truncated\u2019 coronavirus main proteinases (Lu and Denison, 1997; Ziebuhr et al., 1997; Ng and Liu, 2000), should be significantly reduced. The TGEV Mpro deletion mutants tested for activity comprised (i) domains I and II (Mpro\u0394184\u2013302); (ii) domains I and II together with the entire loop region (Mpro\u0394200\u2013302); or (iii) domains I and II combined with the loop region but lacking the five N-terminal residues (Mpro\u03941\u20135/\u0394200\u2013 302). As Table I shows, Mpro\u0394200\u2013302 had clearly detectable (albeit significantly reduced) activity (0.4% of Mpro). Similarly, the mutant Mpro\u03941\u20135/\u0394200\u2013302 had significantly reduced activity (0.6% of Mpro). In sharp contrast, no activities were detectable for Mpro\u0394184\u2013302 and the active site mutant, Mpro-C144A (the latter being used as a negative control). The fact that residues 184\u2013199 proved to be indispensable for proteolytic activity supports our model of substrate binding (Figure 7) in which residues of the loop are predicted to be critically involved in the formation of a \u03b2-sheet-type structure with the substrate (see above). The data also show that an intact N-terminus and the C-terminal domain are required for full activity. The structure suggests that the additional \u03b1-helical domain III as well as the N-terminal residues help fix domains II and the loop 184\u2013199 in a catalytically competent orientation. It will be interesting to investigate whether similar mechanisms are also operating in other 3C-like proteinases with (smaller) C-terminal domains (e.g. arteriviruses and potyviruses; Ziebuhr et al., 2000; Hegyi et al., 2002).",

Thus, calculation of the electrostatic potential (Nicholls et al., 1991) does not reveal an overall basic character of domain III, nor are there distinct patches of basic or aromatic residues (data not shown).

Also, the conserved picornavirus sequence motif, KFRDI, located between domains I and II, as well as the small helices and reverse turns that together form the RNA-binding site of HAV 3Cpro (Bergmann et al., 1997) are missing in the TGEV Mpro structure.",

            "text": "The unit cell dimensions, as well as the self-rotation function (ALMN; CCP4, 1994), implied that several monomers were present in the asymmetric unit. A Matthews coefficient (Matthews, 1968) of 2.3 \u212b3/Da and a solvent content of 51% were obtained assuming six molecules in the asymmetric unit. The bottleneck of the structure determination was the identification of the 60 selenium positions (six monomers with 10 Se each). Solving the problem by SnB v2.0 (Weeks and Miller, 1999) required data of increased precision, which were obtained by averaging of several data sets and monitoring the process by Rpim (Weiss and Hilgenfeld, 1997). Only after we had combined three merged peak-wavelength data sets with two merged edge-wavelength data sets (redundancy = 18) were we able to obtain 105 solutions (from 5000 trials) with significantly reduced minimal function values (Rmin = 0.49, CC = 0.51; Hauptman, 1991) (details to be published elsewhere). The positions of the best 60 atom solutions from SnB were examined for NCS. In total, 37 positions were found to obey a 2-fold NCS. This symmetry predicted a further 11 positions. All 48 positions were used in MLPHARE (CCP4, 1994) for phasing, followed by solvent flattening and NCS averaging in DM (Cowtan and Main, 1996). The resulting electron density maps were of sufficient quality for chain tracing. The first monomer was built manually into the experimental electron density map, using the program \u2018O\u2019 (Jones et al., 1991). All other monomers were generated by NCS. NCS restraints were applied during the initial stages of refinement at low resolution and later gradually released as the resolution limit was extended to 1.96 \u212b.",

To substitute the Mpro residues Cys144 (by Ala) and His163 (by Leu), the corresponding codons were replaced in pMal-Mpro by site-directed mutagenesis using a recombination-PCR method (Yao et al., 1992). The details of the primers used for cloning and mutagenesis and the amino acid sequences of the recombinant proteins expressed and tested for proteolytic activity are given in Table I. The plasmid DNAs were transformed into E.coli TB1 cells and the recombinant proteins were synthesized, affinity purified and cleaved with factor Xa as described previously (Hegyi et al., 2002). The purity and structural integrity of the mutant proteins were analysed by SDS\u2013PAGE. The control protein for this experiment, wild-type TGEV Mpropro, was purified in an identical manner. Enzymatic activities of the mutant proteins were measured by using a peptide cleavage assay (Ziebuhr et al., 1997) with a peptide substrate representing the N-terminal TGEV Mpro autoprocessing site (H2N-VSVNSTLQSGLRKMA-COOH; letters in bold indicate the scissile bond that is cleaved by Mpro).",
